```{r}
load('fastrak.Rda')
source('functions.R')

fastrak = preclean(fastrak)
```

What is the longest run of good data that we have at any of the stations?

```{r}
sr = getstation(4300, fastrak)

findmaxrun = function(times){
    dates = sort(times)
    datediff = diff(dates)
    r = rle(as.numeric(datediff))$lengths
    max(r)
}

findmaxrun(sr$time)
```

```{r}
maxruns = tapply(fastrak$time, fastrak$station, findmaxrun)
```

```{r}
max(maxruns, na.rm=TRUE)

hist(maxruns)
```

Still 3056. How many days / months is that?

```{r}
3056 / (30 * 24)
```

About 4 months. So not that bad. Maybe after we do the filtering for
outliers in the ANOVA we can find the best of these.


```{r}
