```{r}
library(biglm)
load('fastrak.Rda')
```

Wow this is so much faster than doing all the preprocessing every time!

```{r}
head(fastrak)
# Should be all factors except count
sapply(fastrak, class)
dim(fastrak)
hist(fastrak$count)
hist(sqrt(fastrak$count))

fit1 = biglm(sqrt(count) ~ station + hour + weekday + month + year, fastrak)
```

Fitting this model takes a good 10 minutes on my laptop.

```{r}
s1 = summary(fit1)

```
