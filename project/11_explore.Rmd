Focusing on a particular time series now.

We expect that the first one is too low because of a sensor failure.
Drop it.

```{r}
load('santarosa.Rda')
sr = santarosa[-1, ]

res = with(santarosa, xts(residuals, order.by=time))

head(res)
```


```{r}
plot(sr$
```

```{r}
acf(sr$residuals)
acf(res)
```

```{r}
srfit = aov(count^(1/3) ~ month + weekday*hour, sr)
smallres = residuals(srfit)
plot(sr$time[1:400], smallres[1:400], type='l')
```

```{r}
acf(smallres)
pacf(smallres)
```
