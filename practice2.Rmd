Practice problem set 2

Problem 3

Simulate 200 values from $X_t = \sin(\frac(t)(20) + Z_t$ where $Z_t$ iid
with mean 0 and variance 0.25.

Might be interesting to use different distributions for x.

```{r}
n = 200

t = 1:n
z = rnorm(n, sd = sqrt(0.25))
x = sin(t / 20) + z 

plot(t, x)
```

Check for whiteness using sample ACF.

```{r}
acf(x)

# Verify location of the confidence interval line
2 / sqrt(n)
```

All of these are over the noise variance, so we conclude that this is not
white noise.

The Portmanteau test:

```{r}
Box.test(x, lag=20, type='Ljung')
```
TODO- what's the significance of the lag?

Tiny p-value.
