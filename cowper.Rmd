Looking at Cowpertwait and Metcalfe's Introductory Time Series with R

# Chapter 1

```{r}
data(AirPassengers)
AP = AirPassengers
plot(AP)
plot(aggregate(AP))
boxplot(AP ~ cycle(AP))
```


```{r}
d = decompose(AP, type='add')
plot(d)
```

```{r}
d2 = decompose(AP, type='mult')
plot(d2)
```

```{r}
r = na.omit(d2$random)
ra = acf(r)
a = acf(AP)
```

P. 74 simulated random walk

```{r}
x = rnorm(201)
y = cumsum(x)
acf(y)
acf(x)
```

MA(1) 

```{r}
x = arima.sim(list(ma=0.9999), 200)
acf(x)
```

AR(1)

```{r}
x = arima.sim(list(ar=0.9999), 200)
acf(x)
plot(x)
acf(diff(x))
```
This AR(1) process has even more than a random walk.
We conclude that it's difficult to distinguish an AR(1) process
from a random walk if the parameter is near 1. This follows directly from
the derivation for the ACF.
